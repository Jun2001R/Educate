<div class="question__answer">
    <h4>What is online learning like?</h4>
    <p>For those who have never encountered online learning, the biggest question
         is often what it is actually like. The caveat, as you know, is that online
          learning comes in several forms. Therefore, this is your chance to explain
           that to people. Point out that there are different types of online courses
            and programs, and that they’ll have to decide which is best for them. Then,
             explain the types of courses you offer and how your online programs work to
              give them all the information they need. This not only gives them information,
               but it increases their trust
         because you’re being transparent and giving them straightforward answers. </p>

<div class="question__answer">
    <h4>Can I learn at my own pace?</h4>
    <p>This is another common question that people have about online courses. 
        There are usually self-paced programs and traditional classroom or meeting-style programs available
        . Today’s world is full of busy people that want to better themselves, so the self-paced programs
         are popular. Whether or not you provide this option, be sure to answer this question for people and 
         explain the pros and cons of each type of learning. As a bonus
        , you can even invite them to contact you for more information or to discuss what their options are. </p>

<div class="question__answer">
    <h4>Are you accredited or licensed by educational organizations?</h4>
    <p>There isn’t always a need for licensing or accreditation for online courses. However,
         some programs do require it. Either way, people will usually ask what type of training
          or background you have, as well as any licensing that’s available if that’s relevant.
           Make sure that you answer this question by telling them if you do hold any licenses
            or accreditation, as well as by explaining whether or not those are needed, and why.
             It gives them the confidence that you have the right experience and boosts your credibility
         because you’re offering additional information for the sake of education alone. </p>

<div class="question__answer">
    <h4> Does online learning really work?</h4>
    <p>There’s always a skeptic, and when it comes to online learning
        , there are often several of them. Everyone wants to know if 
        online courses “really work”—and that’s a hard question to an
        swer because there are several factors to consider.
         On a general basis, yes, online learning can be effective.
          However, that depends on whether the courses are set up properly, 
          the provider is educated and experienced, and if the person taking the courses 
          does well in a virtual learning environment. You should be able to explain these things
           to people so that they know what they’re getting into. Then,
         you can invite them to contact you to discuss whether it would be right for them. </p>

<div class="question__answer">
    <h4>What types of assignments do you give?
</h4>
    <p>Like knowing the format of online learning, people often want to know the type of work
         they’ll be doing when they take online courses. Be sure to provide a glimpse of what 
         you offer here and link to previous projects or assignments if you can. You can also 
         link to course or program pages. As long as you explain to people how the courses are 
         taught and what they can expect in terms of coursework, 
        you’ll be helping them make a better decision about their educational needs.</p>

    <h4> What are the requirements to take the courses or sign up with your website?</h4>
    <p>People will want to know how to get started. You can link them to the
         pages on your website that help them through that process, but you’ll 
         also want to take the time to explain it to them here. If you have certain
          enrollment windows, for example, list those. If payment or deposits are required,
           explain that, as well. Make sure that people know exactly what they need to do to take online courses 
        from you, no matter what those courses might be. </p>

    <h4>What are the technology requirements?</h4>
    <p>In the same vein, people need to know whether their computers are up to snuff.
         You’ll want to explain all the software that you use and what kind of technology
          people need to take your online courses. If there are certain programs or applications
           used, put those here. If you have the option to provide technology or direct people to
            the appropriate purchase, you should do that here, as well. Reassure people that you
             can help them with the requirements and that they can
         contact you to discuss whether their system meets the demands of your online courses. </p>

<div class="question__answer">
    <h4>How much do courses cost ?</h4>
    <p>Even when it comes to education and training,
         people want to be careful with their money.
          Some people are on a tight budget. Others just
           want to be mindful of what they spend. Either way,
            everyone is going to want to know how much online courses 
            are going to cost. If you have a set list of prices, provide
             those here. You can also advise whether there are payment plans 
             or financial assistance, or if you work with any type of student loan funding. 

This is also a great place to link to your pricing page or to course 
pages where you list the course requirements and costs, allowing people 
to further their research without having to find the information on their own.
